🛠️ Similar smaller bundles of the above perks.

🎯 So What’s in It for You?
In Bangladeshi Taka:
$3,736 USD ≈ 436,000 BDT+ — and that’s just cash.
Add in all the premium tools, credits, educational platforms, and cloud infra? You’re sitting on about $7,000+ USD value total.

And you’re building a serious AI that can potentially trade better than half of Wall Street, so the MVP alone could get VC eyes later if you wanted.

So yes — you build SHADOW in 10 days, execute like a sniper, and if the judges have even a single functioning neuron, this thing is MVP GOD material.

Let’s go claim your crown. 🧠👑💸








You said:
Yeah so how much of SHADOW we building for this thing in 10 days


ChatGPT said:
🔥 Alright, Saniul — let’s get tactical and laser-focus on what we're building in these 10 days to win this damn hackathon.

Remember, this is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) challenge. That means:
📌 "Only what’s needed to prove it works — not the full war machine."
So we don’t need to finish SHADOW in its final form. We just need to show the judges:

“Hey, look. It works. It’s smart. It’s profitable. It’s scalable. Give me the prize.”
Now here’s the stripped-down, high-impact battle plan:

⚙️ SHADOW Hackathon MVP Scope (10-Day Build)
✅ MUST-HAVE CORE SUBMODULES (TO WIN)
Submodule	Include?	Reason
S.C.A.L.E.	✅ Yes	Needed to grab live price feed from binance api (even if basic + hardcoded pair like BTC/USD)
G.R.I.M.	✅ Yes	Load & structure historical data (CSV/SQLite) — required for training
F.L.A.R.E.	✅ Yes	Critical to show real-world understanding from news (at least one news source + basic FinBERT)
P.H.A.N.T.O.M.	✅ Yes	The core model. This MUST be working to do any prediction
E.C.H.O.	✅ Yes	You need it to show outputs — use CLI and webhook to Discord = bonus points
V.E.I.L.	🔶 Paper-mode only	Needed to show mock trade logic + gains logged. Don’t need full feedback learning, just logging wins/losses

🧊 OPTIONAL FOR MVP (SAVE FOR AFTER HACKATHON)
Submodule	Include?	Reason
S.P.E.C.T.R.E.	❌ Not now	Way too complex with TOR/proxy rotation. Use a placeholder scraper or one free API for now
B.L.A.D.E.	❌ Not now	You don’t need to compile into .bin for MVP. Judges care more about the working Python demo and video presentation

🔨 Deliverables to Build
🛠️ What You Will Actually Build:
Deliverable	Tool/Tech
Price scraper from binance api	Python + Selenium or simple screen-capture OCR
Simple CSV database (GRIM)	pandas + daily logs
Basic FinBERT-based or dictionary-based news sentiment	HuggingFace + fine-tuned or pretrained
Model (PHANTOM)	LSTM or Transformer, TensorFlow (CPU)
Output handler (ECHO)	Discord webhook + optional CLI log
Mock trader (VEIL)	Logs mock trades in CSV, calculates % gain/loss
Final MVP Video Demo	Show CLI or browser + webhook in action
GitHub Repo	Code, README.md, setup instructions

⏰ 10-Day Timeline
Day	Goal
Day 1	Setup GitHub, data structure folders, basic CLI
Day 2	Build S.C.A.L.E. to grab BTC/USD from binance api
Day 3	Load historical data into GRIM, process to model format
Day 4-5	Implement PHANTOM v1 — basic LSTM or transformer + train
Day 6	Plug in basic news sentiment pipeline (FLARE)
Day 7	Connect predictions to ECHO (webhook + CLI output)
Day 8	VEIL runs paper trades + logs accuracy/gains
Day 9	Create MVP demo video showing entire flow
Day 10	Final polish, README.md, submit to Devpost, collapse in glory

🧾 MVP Output Format

Prediction: 1 (LONG)
Confidence: 84.27
Timestamp: 20250708155013
Logged to:

CLI

Discord

CSV

💥 Bottom Line
You're building the central nervous system of SHADOW, just not the entire mech suit.

By hackathon’s end, you should have a fully working prototype that:

Watches BTC/USD live

Predicts 1 or 0 using historical prices + news

Logs % gains from those calls

Sends signals to Discord

Has clear potential for real-world use

That’s more than enough to blow 90% of MVPs out of the water.
