# S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Development Plan for SHADOW AI
This document outlines the development plan for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Stealthy Proxy & Extraction Covert Tactical Retrieval Engine), a critical submodule of the SHADOW AI (Strategic Heuristic AI for Data-Driven Order Writing) system. S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is tasked with stealthily scraping news data from a wide range of global sources, bypassing restrictions, and providing raw data to other submodules for analysis and prediction. This plan ensures that S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is undetectable, efficient, and scalable, while integrating seamlessly with the larger SHADOW AI architecture.

# 1. Introduction to S.P.E.C.T.R.E.
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. serves as the intelligence-gathering arm of SHADOW AI, designed to collect news data from diverse sources worldwide without detection. Its primary role is to scrape news articles, social media posts, and other relevant content, delivering raw data that is subsequently analyzed by F.L.A.R.E. (Filtered Linguistic Analysis & Reaction Engine) and utilized by P.H.A.N.T.O.M. (Predictive Heuristic AI for Navigating Trades & Order Management) to forecast market movements.
Key Features and Capabilities

Stealth Scraping: Employs TOR, rotating proxies, and spoofed headers to bypass geo-restrictions, paywalls, and bot detection mechanisms.
Comprehensive Data Collection: Captures all types of news (financial, political, health, economic, environmental, military, tech, etc.) to identify any event potentially impacting markets.
Date-Aware Logic: Identifies and fills gaps in historical data (up to 2 years) and scrapes daily news in real-time.
Raw Data Storage: Stores scraped data in raw formats (.txt, .csv, .db) for immediate access by other submodules.
Fault Tolerance: Implements retry mechanisms for failed scrapes and logs permanent failures for review.


# 2. Architecture of S.P.E.C.T.R.E.
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is structured into two distinct components: the Scraper Unit (Part 1) and the Analyzer/Bookkeeper (Part 2), with a strict one-way data flow from Part 1 to Part 2. However, based on the SHADOW AI system design, the analysis and NLP tasks are delegated to F.L.A.R.E., leaving S.P.E.C.T.R.E. focused solely on data acquisition and raw storage.
Components and Their Functions

## Scraper Unit (Part 1):
Role: Stealthily scrapes news data from various sources and saves it in raw formats.
Features: Uses advanced evasion techniques (TOR, proxies, header rotation) and handles both live and retroactive scraping for complete data coverage.


## Analyzer/Bookkeeper (Part 2):
Role: Originally intended to process and store data for SHADOW AI use, but this functionality is now assigned to F.L.A.R.E.
Revised Role: Ensures raw data is correctly logged and organized in a structured directory for F.L.A.R.E. to access, with no analysis performed by S.P.E.C.T.R.E.



## Data Flow

The Scraper Unit collects raw data and saves it to /output_buffer/ as JSON files.
The Analyzer/Bookkeeper moves these files to /news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/ in .txt, .csv, and .db formats, maintaining a structured archive.
No data flows back to the Scraper Unit, ensuring isolation and security.
F.L.A.R.E. then reads from /news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/ for further processing.


# 3. Operational Flow
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. follows a precise operational sequence to ensure efficient and stealthy data collection.
Initialization and Startup Procedures

On startup, S.P.E.C.T.R.E. scans the /news_logs/ directory for existing data within the last 2 years.
Identifies missing dates by comparing file names (e.g., 20250708.csv) against a 2-year range.
Prioritizes retroactive scraping for missing dates using historical sources (e.g., archives, Wayback Machine).
Once historical data is complete, shifts to daily scraping for the current date.

## Data Scraping Process

Utilizes broad search tags (e.g., "news", "events", "global") to capture all news types, not limited to predefined sources.
Scrapes headlines, body text, timestamps, and source information from search results or direct site access.
Employs stealth techniques to avoid detection (detailed in Section 4).

## Data Extraction and Storage

Extracts raw HTML and saves it as JSON files in /output_buffer/ with fields:
source: Name of the source (e.g., "CNN").
timestamp: Date and time of the article (e.g., "2025-07-08T15:30:21Z").
headline: Article title.
body: Full article text.
url: Original URL.
raw_html: Optional raw HTML for backup.
meta: Scrape metadata (e.g., IP used, agent).


The Analyzer/Bookkeeper moves these JSON files to /news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/ and converts them into:
.txt: Raw text dump of the article.
.csv: Structured tabular data (timestamp, source, headline, body).
.db: SQLite database for querying.




# 4. Stealth and Evasion Techniques
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is engineered to operate undetected, employing a multi-layered approach to bypass restrictions and avoid detection.
Proxy and IP Rotation

Routes traffic through TOR using SOCKS5 proxies and exit nodes.
Maintains a pool of rotating proxies (SOCKS5, residential, datacenter) sourced from free lists or commercial providers (e.g., Oxylabs).
Integrates VPNs with automation APIs (e.g., Mullvad) for additional anonymity.
Validates proxies periodically and caches working ones.

## User-Agent and Header Spoofing

Rotates user-agents from a pool mimicking various browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and devices (desktop, mobile).
Spoofs HTTP headers (e.g., Accept-Language, Referer) to avoid fingerprinting.
Randomizes header combinations per request.

## Delay and Timing Strategies

Injects random delays between requests (1.5–6 seconds) to mimic human behavior.
Uses adaptive throttling based on site response codes (e.g., back off on 429 Too Many Requests).

## Handling CAPTCHAs and Blocks

Detects CAPTCHAs or blocks (e.g., 403, 429) and retries with a different proxy or IP.
After 5 failed attempts, skips the source and logs the failure in /logs/spectre_failures.log.
Attempts alternative mirrors (e.g., archive.is) or cached versions (e.g., Google Cache).

## Advanced Evasion

Uses Playwright or Selenium with stealth plugins to render JavaScript-heavy sites and bypass paywalls.
Overrides geolocation and timezone settings to defeat location-based restrictions.
Employs disposable browser profiles to eliminate cookie trails.


# 5. Data Handling and Storage
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. ensures all scraped data is stored in a structured, accessible format for immediate use by F.L.A.R.E.
File Formats and Structures

.txt: Raw text dumps of news articles, one article per line with timestamp and source prefix (e.g., [2025-07-08 13:22:01] CNN: ...).
.csv: Structured tabular data with fields:
timestamp: ISO8601 format.
source: Source name.
headline: Article title.
body: Full text.
url: Source URL.


.db: SQLite database with a news_logs table:CREATE TABLE news_logs (
    uid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TEXT,
    source TEXT,
    headline TEXT,
    body TEXT,
    url TEXT
);



Directory Organization

Data is stored in /news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/ with subfolders:
/csv/YYYYMMDD.csv: Daily CSV files.
/sqlite/YYYYMMDD.db: Daily SQLite databases.
/txt/YYYYMMDD.txt: Daily text dumps.


Example:/news_logs/
  ├── 202507/
  │   ├── raw/
  │   │   ├── csv/
  │   │   │   └── 20250708.csv
  │   │   ├── sqlite/
  │   │   │   └── 20250708.db
  │   │   └── txt/
  │   │       └── 20250708.txt
  ├── 202508/



Data Integrity and Backup

Tolerates duplicate articles, as timestamps ensure correct historical context.
Stores data uncompressed for fast access by F.L.A.R.E.
Logs scraping failures for manual review or retry.


# 6. Integration with SHADOW AI
S.P.E.C.T.R.E. acts as the data provider for SHADOW AI’s analytical and predictive components.
Interaction with F.L.A.R.E.

S.P.E.C.T.R.E. delivers raw data to /news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/.
F.L.A.R.E. reads this data, performs NLP analysis (sentiment scoring, categorization), and writes processed outputs to /news_logs/YYYYMM/nlp/.

Providing Data to P.H.A.N.T.O.M.

P.H.A.N.T.O.M. uses F.L.A.R.E.’s processed data (stored in /news_logs/YYYYMM/nlp/) to correlate news events with price movements and generate binary trade predictions (1 = long, 0 = short).

Communication with Other Submodules

S.P.E.C.T.R.E. operates independently, with no direct interaction beyond providing raw data to F.L.A.R.E.
Its role ends once data is stored, ensuring a clean handoff.
