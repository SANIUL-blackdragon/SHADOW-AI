## AI Model Development
The core AI engine, P.H.A.N.T.O.M., is designed to predict market trends a few days ahead, outputting binary signals (1 for long, 0 for short). The model architecture and training process are as follows:
- **Architecture**:
  - **Price Input**: An LSTM network processing sequences of 30 daily closing prices, outputting a 64-dimensional vector.
  - **News Input**: A dense layer processing sequences of 30 daily sentiment scores, outputting a 64-dimensional vector.
  - **Combination**: Concatenate the two vectors (128 dimensions) and pass through a dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- **Training**:
  - **Data**: Use historical price and news data, with sequences of 30 days as input and a target label indicating whether the price increases after 3 days (1) or not (0).
  - **Loss Function**: Binary cross-entropy.
  - **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, and percentage gains in mock trading.
  - **Optimization**: Use Adam optimizer with hyperparameter tuning for learning rate and batch size.
- **Functionality**:
  - Recognize market behavior without news influence, analyzing price trends and trader reactions.
  - Identify market behavior under news influence, discerning event types, reaction magnitudes, and patterns.
  - Predict market direction 3 days ahead, based on learned patterns.

## Operational Modes
The system operates in two modes:
- **Mock Trading Mode (V.E.I.L.)**:
  - Simulate trades based on daily predictions, taking long (1) or short (0) positions for the S&P 500 index, holding for 3 days.
  - Track percentage gains per trade as the primary metric, aiming to maximize average returns.
  - Use live data for further training, fine-tuning the model to adapt to current market conditions.
- **Actual Trading Mode (E.C.H.O., Later)**:
  - Send trade signals via Discord webhooks using Discord.py, enabling manual execution.
  - Prepare for future integration with a brokerage API for automated trading.

## Live Data Integration
The live data pipeline ensures real-time predictions:
- **S.C.A.L.E.**:
  - Use the tradingview-scraper library to fetch real-time OHLCV data from TradingView, configured for stocks (e.g., NASDAQ:AAPL).
  - Stream data every minute, aggregating to daily for model input.
- **S.P.E.C.T.R.E.**:
  - Implement a Scrapy-based scraper with Bright Data proxies to collect live news from financial websites.
  - Process news with F.L.A.R.E. to generate real-time sentiment scores, aggregated daily.

- **News Data**:
  - Process news text with FinBERT to generate sentiment scores (-1 to 1).
  - Aggregate daily sentiment scores by averaging scores for all articles on a given day.
  - Align news timestamps with price data, ensuring daily correspondence.
- **Labeling**:
  - For each day t, label as 1 if price_t+3 > price_t, else 0, indicating whether the price increases after 3 days.
  - Store preprocessed data in a structured format for training.

### Step 4: AI Model Development
- Design a dual-input neural network:
  - Price branch: LSTM with 30 time steps, 1 feature (closing price), outputting a 64-dimensional vector.
  - News branch: Dense layer with 30 daily sentiment scores, outputting a 64-dimensional vector.
  - Concatenate outputs and pass through a dense layer with sigmoid activation.
- Train the model using TensorFlow or PyTorch:
  - Split data into 80% training, 20% validation.
  - Use binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
  - Monitor accuracy, F1-score, and mock trading performance.
