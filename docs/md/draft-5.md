# F.L.A.R.E. Development Plan for SHADOW AI
## 1. Introduction to F.L.A.R.E.
F.L.A.R.E. (Filtered Linguistic Analysis & Reaction Engine) is a pivotal submodule within the SHADOW AI (Strategic Heuristic AI for Data-Driven Order Writing) system. Its primary function is to transform unstructured news data—scraped globally by S.P.E.C.T.R.E.—into structured, numerical signals that P.H.A.N.T.O.M. leverages to predict market movements. F.L.A.R.E. processes a diverse range of news topics (e.g., health, politics, economics, tech, environment) to detect events that could influence key assets like BTC, Gold, and S&P 500, delivering actionable insights with precision and adaptability.
Key Features and Capabilities

Broad-Spectrum Data Processing: Handles all news types without topic assumptions, ensuring comprehensive market coverage.
Multi-Metric Scoring: Generates sentiment scores, urgency, impact scope, and more, each with confidence and decay estimates.
Topic Classification: Categorizes news into domains for specialized analysis.
Asset-Relevance Scoring: Links news to specific assets with learned weights.
Impact Scaling: Adjusts scores based on event severity within categories.
Temporal Alignment: Aligns news with trading sessions for market relevance.
Advanced Event Linking: Tracks multi-hop causal chains for indirect impacts.
Self-Reflection: Uses meta-scoring and feedback loops to refine accuracy.

## 2. Architecture of F.L.A.R.E.
F.L.A.R.E. is a modular system that processes raw news through distinct components, integrating seamlessly with S.P.E.C.T.R.E. for input and P.H.A.N.T.O.M. for output. It includes a subcomponent, S.E.A.R. (Semantic Event Analysis & Reflection), for advanced event tracking and self-evaluation.
Components and Their Functions

Data Ingestion: Reads raw text from /news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/ directories.
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text for analysis.
Topic Classifier: Assigns categories (e.g., health, politics) using a multi-label model.
Sentiment Analysis Engine: Employs category-specific, fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., DistilBERT, RoBERTa).
Relevance Scorer: Calculates asset-specific relevance with hybrid scoring.
Impact Scaler: Applies severity multipliers within categories.
Temporal Aligner: Buckets timestamps into market sessions.
S.E.A.R. Submodule:
Multi-Hop Event Linker: Identifies indirect impacts with confidence decay.
Meta-Scoring Engine: Evaluates confidence in scores and decay periods.
Feedback Processor: Adjusts scoring based on V.E.I.L. trade outcomes.



Data Flow

Input: Raw news from S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (/news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/).
Processing: F.L.A.R.E. cleans, classifies, scores, and aligns data.
Output: Structured records to /news_logs/YYYYMM/nlp/ for P.H.A.N.T.O.M.

## 3. Operational Flow
F.L.A.R.E. follows a systematic process to convert raw news into actionable signals.
Initialization and Startup

Scans /news_logs/YYYYMM/raw/ for new data.
Uses a checkpoint system (e.g., SQLite table) to track processed files.

Data Processing Steps

Ingest Raw Data: Loads text from S.P.E.C.T.R.E.’s output.
Clean and Normalize Text: Removes HTML, normalizes whitespace, tokenizes.
Classify Topics: Tags news with categories (e.g., tech, military).
Analyze Sentiment: Runs category-specific models, with VADER/TextBlob fallback.
Score Relevance: Computes asset-specific scores using keywords and weights.
Scale Impact: Adjusts scores by severity (e.g., "pandemic" > "flu").
Align Temporally: Assigns market session buckets (pre-market, market-hours, post-market).
Link Events: S.E.A.R. traces multi-hop chains with confidence decay.
Generate Output: Produces detailed records with meta-scores.
