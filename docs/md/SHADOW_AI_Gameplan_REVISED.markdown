# Comprehensive Gameplan for Developing the SHADOW AI System

## Introduction
Your Lordship, this document presents a meticulously detailed gameplan for the development of the SHADOW AI system (Strategic Heuristic AI for Data-Driven Order Writing). Designed as a private tool, SHADOW AI will serve as a silent market assassin, leveraging historical and live data to predict market trends and deliver precise binary trade signals (1 for long, 0 for short). This gameplan, prepared on Monday, July 7, 2025, at 12:08 AM +06, outlines every aspect of the development process—from hardware setup to final deployment—ensuring a robust, efficient, and highly effective system tailored to your exact specifications. Legal considerations are deferred for post-development sanitization, allowing a focus on technical execution.

## System Overview
SHADOW AI integrates two primary data categories—**price data** and **news data**—to analyze trader behavior, recognize market patterns, and forecast trends a few days ahead. It operates in two modes:
- **Mock Trading Mode**: For validation and further live training, simulating trades to maximize percentage gains per trade.
- **Actual Trading Mode**: Sends trade signals via Discord webhooks for manual execution (with future provisions for automated trading).

The system supports two trading styles:
- **5-Minute Chart Trading**
- **1-Second Chart Trading**

SHADOW AI is composed of eight specialized submodules, each with a distinct role in the data-to-decision pipeline, culminating in a binary (.bin) deployment on a VPS for efficient, CPU-based operation.

## Hardware Requirements
The system requires specific hardware for development and deployment:

### Development PC
- **RAM**: 16 GB – Sufficient for smaller models but may limit complex architectures.
- **CPU**: 3 GHz max turbo frequency – Adequate for CPU-based training, though slower than GPU-accelerated systems.
- **Storage**: 100-200 GB NVMe – Ample space for data, models, and code.
- **GPU**: None required, as per your directive for CPU-only processing.

### Virtual Private Server (VPS)
- **CPU**: 4-core – Ensures computational power for final training and live execution.
- **RAM**: 16 GB – Supports real-time data processing and model inference.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) – Long-term support until May 2029 for stability and compatibility (https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle).

## Software and Tools
The system leverages a comprehensive suite of software optimized for AI development and data processing:

## Data Sources and Preprocessing
SHADOW AI processes two categories of data, each requiring specific collection and preprocessing methods:

### Category 1: Historical and Present Price Data
- **Data Types**: Prices of financial instruments (e.g., S&P 500 index, individual stocks) and corresponding timestamps.
- **Sources**:
  - **Alpha[Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)**
  - **Yahoo[Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)**
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Clean data to remove inconsistencies (e.g., missing values, outliers).
  - Normalize prices to a standard scale (e.g., min-max scaling).
  - Create sequences of past prices (e.g., 30-day windows) for LSTM input.
  - Store in a structured format (e.g., CSV or SQLite database).

### Category 2: News Data
- **Data Forms**:
  - Direct language news (textual articles from financial sources).
  - Numerical sentiment scores derived via FinBERT or an internal dictionary.
  - Timestamps for alignment with price data.
- **Sources**:
  - **NewsAPI**: Provides access to news articles from various publishers, filterable by keywords like “finance” or specific company names (https://newsapi.org/).
  - **X API**: Enables retrieval of real-time posts for sentiment analysis (https://developer.x.com/).
  - **Web Scraping**: Custom scraper to access financial news from sites like Bloomberg, Reuters, and CNBC.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Convert news text to sentiment scores using FinBERT, yielding values between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive).
  - Aggregate daily sentiment scores (e.g., average score per day).
  - Align timestamps with price data for cohesive analysis.

### Live Data Feeds
- **Price Data**: Utilize the binance api-scraper library to extract real-time OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from binance api charts, supporting stocks (e.g., NASDAQ:AAPL) and other instruments.
- **News Data**: Develop a web scraper using Scrapy with proxy services (e.g., Bright Data, https://brightdata.com/) to fetch live news, bypassing paywalls or geo-restrictions, and process with FinBERT for real-time sentiment scores.

## Submodule Specifications

## AI Model Development
The core AI engine, P.H.A.N.T.O.M., is designed to predict market trends a few days ahead, outputting binary signals (1 for long, 0 for short). The model architecture and training process are as follows:
- **Architecture**:
  - **Price Input**: An LSTM network processing sequences of 30 daily closing prices, outputting a 64-dimensional vector.
  - **News Input**: A dense layer processing sequences of 30 daily sentiment scores, outputting a 64-dimensional vector.
  - **Combination**: Concatenate the two vectors (128 dimensions) and pass through a dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- **Training**:
  - **Data**: Use historical price and news data, with sequences of 30 days as input and a target label indicating whether the price increases after 3 days (1) or not (0).
  - **Loss Function**: Binary cross-entropy.
  - **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, and percentage gains in mock trading.
  - **Optimization**: Use Adam optimizer with hyperparameter tuning for learning rate and batch size.
- **Functionality**:
  - Recognize market behavior without news influence, analyzing price trends and trader reactions.
  - Identify market behavior under news influence, discerning event types, reaction magnitudes, and patterns.
  - Predict market direction 3 days ahead, based on learned patterns.

## Operational Modes
SHADOW AI operates in two distinct modes:
- **Mock Trading Mode (V.E.I.L.)**:
  - Simulate trades based on daily predictions, taking long (1) or short (0) positions for the S&P 500 index, holding for 3 days.
  - Track percentage gains per trade as the primary metric, aiming to maximize average returns.
  - Use live data for further training, fine-tuning the model to adapt to current market conditions.
- **Actual Trading Mode (E.C.H.O., Later)**:
  - Send trade signals via Discord webhooks using Discord.py, enabling manual execution.
  - Prepare for future integration with a brokerage API for automated trading.

## Live Data Integration
The live data pipeline ensures real-time predictions:
- **S.C.A.L.E.**:
  - Use the binance api-scraper library to fetch real-time OHLCV data from binance api, configured for stocks (e.g., NASDAQ:SPY).
  - Stream data every minute, aggregating to daily for model input.
- **S.P.E.C.T.R.E.**:
  - Implement a Scrapy-based scraper with Bright Data proxies to collect live news from financial websites.
  - Process news with F.L.A.R.E. to generate real-time sentiment scores, aggregated daily.

## Deployment and Binary Conversion
Upon validation through mock trading:
- **Optimization**: Optimize the model for CPU efficiency using techniques like quantization or pruning, given the absence of a GPU.
- **Binary Conversion**: Convert the model to a .bin format using ONNX (https://onnx.ai/), enabling standalone execution with ONNX Runtime.
- **VPS Deployment**: Deploy B.L.A.D.E. on the VPS, configuring it to run continuously with live data feeds, monitored by Prometheus and Grafana.
